# HotStuff-2 Safety Module

This module implements **safety rule enforcement** and **Byzantine fault detection** for the HotStuff-2 consensus protocol, ensuring that the fundamental safety properties are maintained even under adversarial conditions.

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

### Safety Property Enforcement
- **Vote Safety Rules**: Prevents conflicting votes from honest validators
- **Commit Safety**: Ensures no two conflicting blocks can be committed
- **Lock Mechanism**: Maintains safety across view changes
- **Byzantine Detection**: Identifies and reports safety violations

### Key Components

#### Core Safety Rules (`lib.rs`)

##### Voting Safety
- **Conflicting Vote Prevention**: Prevents validators from voting on conflicting blocks
- **Lock Respect**: Ensures votes respect previously locked blocks
- **View Consistency**: Maintains voting consistency within views
- **Safety Invariants**: Enforces fundamental consensus safety properties

##### Commit Safety
- **Finality Rules**: Defines when blocks can be safely committed
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies potential safety violations
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Handles safety rule violations
- **Accountability**: Tracks safety violations for accountability

#### Message Validation (`message.rs`)

##### Protocol Message Safety
- **Message Authenticity**: Verifies message signatures and origins
- **Temporal Validation**: Ensures messages arrive in valid time windows
- **Sequence Validation**: Validates message ordering and dependencies
- **Byzantine Message Detection**: Identifies malicious or corrupted messages

##### Safety Evidence
- **Violation Proofs**: Cryptographic evidence of safety violations
- **Accountability Evidence**: Proof of Byzantine behavior
- **Recovery Information**: Data needed for safety recovery
- **Audit Trails**: Complete safety-related event logging

## 🔧 Safety Architecture

### Safety Rule Integration

```rust
use hotstuff2_safety::{SafetyRules, VoteDecision, SafetyViolation};

// Initialize safety rules engine
let safety_rules = SafetyRules::new(
    validator_private_key,
    safety_storage,
)?;

// Check if voting is safe
let vote_decision = safety_rules.should_vote(&proposal, current_view)?;
match vote_decision {
    VoteDecision::Vote => {
        // Safe to vote, proceed with voting
        let vote = create_vote(proposal, validator_signature)?;
        broadcast_vote(vote).await?;
    }
    VoteDecision::Abstain(reason) => {
        // Not safe to vote, log reason and abstain
        warn!("Abstaining from vote: {}", reason);
    }
}
```

### Byzantine Detection

```rust
use hotstuff2_safety::{ByzantineDetector, SafetyViolation};

// Monitor for Byzantine behavior
let detector = ByzantineDetector::new(validator_set.clone())?;

// Process incoming messages for violations
if let Some(violation) = detector.check_message(&message, &sender)? {
    match violation {
        SafetyViolation::ConflictingVotes { validator, vote1, vote2 } => {
            // Report conflicting votes from same validator
            report_byzantine_behavior(validator, violation).await?;
        }
        SafetyViolation::InvalidSignature { message, validator } => {
            // Report signature forgery attempt
            blacklist_validator(validator).await?;
        }
    }
}
```

### Safety Storage

```rust
use hotstuff2_safety::{SafetyStorage, LockedBlock};

// Persistent safety state
let mut safety_storage = SafetyStorage::new(storage_path)?;

// Update locked block (critical for safety)
safety_storage.update_locked_block(LockedBlock {
    block_hash: proposal.block_hash(),
    view: current_view,
    justification: proposal.justification(),
})?;

// Verify safety before any vote
let current_lock = safety_storage.get_locked_block()?;
if !proposal.extends_block(&current_lock.block_hash) {
    return Err(SafetyError::ViolatesLock);
}
```

## 📊 Safety Properties

### Fundamental Guarantees
- **Agreement**: No two honest validators commit conflicting blocks
- **Validity**: Only validly proposed blocks can be committed
- **Integrity**: Honest validators' votes cannot be forged
- **Accountability**: Byzantine validators can be identified with proof

### Safety Invariants
- **Vote Consistency**: Validators never vote on conflicting blocks in same view
- **Lock Monotonicity**: Locked blocks advance monotonically in height
- **Justification Validity**: All block justifications are cryptographically valid
- **View Progression**: Views advance in strictly increasing order

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- **Threat Model**: Up to f < n/3 Byzantine validators
- **Safety Preservation**: Maintains safety under all network conditions
- **Detection Capability**: Identifies Byzantine behavior with cryptographic proof
- **Punishment Mechanisms**: Framework for validator accountability

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Security
- **Message Authentication**: All safety-critical messages are signed
- **Non-repudiation**: Byzantine behavior has cryptographic evidence
- **Integrity Protection**: Hash-based message integrity verification
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based message ordering

### Attack Resistance
- **Double Voting**: Detection and prevention of conflicting votes
- **Nothing-at-Stake**: Lock mechanism prevents costless attacks
- **Long Range Attacks**: Historical state validation
- **Grinding Attacks**: Secure randomness and commitments
